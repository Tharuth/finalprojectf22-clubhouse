# Sprint 4 Planning Meeting
We had our sprint 4 planning meeting on November 6th where we decided which user stories we needed to complete for sprint 4. In order to prepare for our final release, we introduced several new user stories for finalizing and integrating the different components and pages of our application, which we then assigned story points using planning poker. Another goal of the meeting was to distribute the user stories and tasks among the team members. All of us participated in the meeting.
