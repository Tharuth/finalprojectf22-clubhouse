# Release Planning Meeting

The release planning meeting was held on September 28th on the official course discord server. All members of our group participated.

## Release goal

Our release goal is to develop a web application that facilitates connection between students and UTSC clubs. In particular, students should be able to discover and search through a database of current clubs and events, and clubs should be able to promote themselves and their activities to prospective students and members. The app should also allow for students to keep track of their club activities, with notifications for club announcements and a calender of upcoming activities.

* register/login to their own account (MIN-1)
* apply for club recruitment/hiring positions (MIN-7, 11)
* discover clubs and events (MIN-3, 4, 6)
