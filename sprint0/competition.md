How is your product different?
 
The key difference between these social platforms and UTSC ClubHouse is that these social platforms while being able to perform certain functionalities are not very streamlined. Our product is meant to be a centralized platform which combine all the features in our competitors and have amazing new ones such as the ability to post announcements that are sent to the membersâ€™ inbox and become members of the club through the webapp. 
Our competitors focused on the features that were necessary for their purpose. Since their main focus was not on clubs but making complete Utsc platforms. With this reason they were not able to deliver a lot of features for people who are more involved in club activities. 
Our users will be any UofT student that wants to follow club events or is a member of any clubs or groups.
