## Tools and decision making: 
A shared Google Drive folder was created for collaborating on deliverables. Each team member chose tasks they felt most comfortable working on. During our standup meetings, we reviewed everyone’s work and made revisions. 

We used our internal discord server for communication. During our meetings, we discussed pros and cons of each option/idea and made decisions by voting after.

## Prioritization: 
We defined priority by assigning high priority to user stories that are must-haves for our website and the features that we want to implement first. 
Low priority - user stories that would be easier to implement after implementing the high and mid priority user stories, and aren’t integral to the experience of the target demographic of the app.

## Meetings: 
We met 4 times, in person and over our internal discord server, during the duration of this sprint. 
	
## Lessons learned: 
In the next sprint, we are planning on scheduling more frequent but shorter meetings to keep the team updated on the progress of the project and to make sure we're all on the same page. Also, we believe that starting work earlier on the next sprint would give us more time to review our work. Therefore, we have agreed to start Sprint 1 immediately after Sprint 0 due date.
