The objective of this web application is to bridge the gap between students and clubs at UTSC, by providing students with a central hub where they can easily connect with clubs and keep up-to-date with upcoming events. Additionally, this application makes it easier for clubs to reach out to new students who may be interested in joining or attending their events.
